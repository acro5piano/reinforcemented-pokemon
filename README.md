# Reinforcemented-pokemon

This is a work-in-progress project of reinforcemented-trained Pokemon, aiming to understand how machine learning (Hopefully Deep-Q learning) works in Rust.

# Getting started

Currently the code just solves a simple maze.

To run it, please run:

```
cargo run
```

If you want to visualize the learning process, please run:

```
cargo run --features visual
```
